      <p className="pb-4 font-light">
        A cookie is a tiny element of data that is stored on your computer's
        hard drive by your web browser when you access a website. The Site makes
        use of the following types of cookie technology: • A "Session cookie",
        which contains a random ID number automatically allocated to your
        computer by the webserver for the duration of your visit. It is meant to
        make your use of the Site faster and easier. It will be deactivated
        after thirty minutes of inactivity on the Site and will be automatically
        removed from your computer when you close your browser. • A "Script
        generated cookie" is automatically allocated to your computer when you
        register to access any restricted areas of the Site and on each
        subsequent visit. It only contains an identifier which will enable the
        Site to identify you as a registered user so that you do not have to
        identify yourself again while you move from one server to another during
        your visit. It will remain on your computer after your visit until you
        remove it. It will be placed again at your next visit.
